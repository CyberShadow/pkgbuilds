pkgbuilds <https://github.com/Earnestly/pkgbuilds>

WHY?

  Most of these packages were created because the ones found in the AUR were
  horrible. The majority of my packages are built from the latest developmental
  branches for both less maintainence burden, as package versions are
  programmatically generated, and for the newest fixes and bugs; hopefully
  fixes moreso than bugs.
  
  The pkgdesc format is losely based on man-pages(7) such as using short
  lowercase descriptions similar to a manual's synopsis. Common variables are
  grouped together to hopefully improve PKGBUILD readability.

NOTES

  - dmenu-pango-imlib

    Pango and imlib patches from <https://github.com/Cloudef> applied to dmenu
    allowing for proper unicode fallback and image generation.

  - htop-vi

    The vi patch adds vi-like movement via hjkl and switches k (kill) key to d.

  - glibc

    Removed all non-UTF-8 charmaps allowing for a simplified locale-gen script.
    Provided an empty /etc/locales for users to add their prefered locale such
    as en_GB without the charmap as only UTF-8 is available.

  - system-config

    A collection of personal configurations for various machines which enables
    installing and managing system configuration as ordinary packages.

  - runit-tools

    The tools without the init.  Busybox also contains implementations of all
    these tools which I may use instead in the future.
