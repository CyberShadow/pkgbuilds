Most of these PKGBUILDs were created because the ones found in the AUR
were horrible.  The majority of my packages are built from the latest
developmental branches for both the newest fixes and bugs, hopefully
fixes moreso than bugs ;-).

== DMENU-PANGO-IMLIB

Pango and imlib patches from https://github.com/Cloudef[Cloudef] applied
to dmenu allowing for proper unicode fallback and image generation.

== GLIBC

Removed all non-UTF-8 charmaps allowing for a simplified `locale-gen`
script. Provided an empty `/etc/locales` for users to add their prefered
locale such as _en_GB_. (No charmap, the UTF-8 part is assumed.)

== SYSTEM-CONFIGS 

Just a small collection of personal configurations for various machines.
